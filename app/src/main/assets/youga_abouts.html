<h4>The health of children has become a matter of great concern all over the world and the WHO, UNO as well as UNESCO have been stressing the importance of developing the potential that is there in our greatest resource-the children of the world. The art and science of Yoga has a lot to offer for the children in terms of their health as well as complete well being. Yoga offers us a tool by which we can provide a safe and healthy future for our beloved children. Yoga is both preventive as well as therapeutic for health problems that face children and is also rehabilitative in many situations. It is also important to understand the special needs of the children when teaching them Yoga and methods to create interest in them for this great jewel of our cultural heritage.</h4>
<h4>Yoga helps children cultivate conscious awareness and increases self-awareness and self-confidence. It teaches children to be gentle with themselves and others and develops focus and concentration. It also develops balance and mental equilibrium along with discipline and a love of learning. It improves performance in all areas of life, including schoolwork and relieves stress while providing a greater sense of general well-being. A regular practice of Yoga increases flexibility, coordination, and strength of the children and assists in the performance of sports activities</h4>

<li>HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN:</li>
<div>Children are a unique segment of our population and have very specific health needs. It is pitiable that more than 40% of deaths are seen in the child population under the age of 5 years. Childhood is the age of both physical and mental growth and also has stressful periods such as puberty and adolescence that affect the health of the growing child and youth</div>
<div>Some of the important health problems facing the child population are:</div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Growth and endocrine disorders</li>
<li>Infectious diseases</li>
<li>Handicaps</li>
<li>Congenital disorders</li>
<li>Chronic diseases of the respiratory tract and heart</li>
<li>Neurological disorders</li>
<li>Liver and renal disorders </li>
<li>Psychological disorders </li>
<li>Skin diseases</li>
<li>Children also need an outlet for their creativity and abundant energy and if this youthful energy isn’t canalized properly it may result in various socially deviant behaviors such as truancy and juvenile delinquency.</li>
</ol>
<li>BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN:</li>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prevention is better than cure: The practice of Yoga from early childhood helps prevent numerous disorders and even if the disorders or disease does occur at a later stage of life, the child would have the knowledge as well as the wherewithal to apply the practice necessary to control, limit or cure the health problem. Improved immunity is a well documented benefit of Yoga practice and this strengthened immunity in addition to the Yogic hygiene and cleanliness developed through practice of Yama and Niyama helps prevent numerous infections from settling down in the child’s system.</li>
<li>At the physical level Asanas, Kriyas, Mudras and Pranayama stabilize and balance the energies of the children and thus contribute to a proper usage of this energy. This is important as otherwise the energies of the child get used up in trivial and unhealthy pursuits of modern life.</li>
<li>Yoga helps to develop all systems of the human body (cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, eliminative, endocrine, nervous and musculoskeletal) thus strengthening, cleansing and purifying the body so that it is brought under our conscious will. Various disorders such as Asthma and Diabetes can be controlled by a regular practice of Yoga.</li>
<li>Children suffering from ATHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) as well as mental retardation and other mental disabilities can be helped by a practice of the Asanas and Pranayamas that help develop better coordination, concentration, mental calmness as well as attention span. In children having epilepsy, Yoga helps to reduce the duration and frequency as well as the severity of the attack. Yoga has also been shown to reduce anxiety and aggressive behaviour in children.</li>
<li>In Yoga, all possible body positions are explored and the body is exercised standing, sitting, lying down (front, side and back) and even upside down! This creates an acute awareness of the entire body, strengthens the body systems and develops flexibility of the body.</li>
<li>Yoga is isometric and internal. It is a contest between our inherent inertia and the power of the will. Parts of the body are pitted against one another and a unique harmony of body, mind and breath is developed. This internal struggle when handled successfully deepens the consciousness of not only the working of the body but also of the mind and emotions.</li>
<li>Pressure created on the internal organs during various Asanas such as Pavanamuktasana, Karnapidasana and Ardha Matsyendrasana helps tone up the entire abdominal area and all organs therein. This helps in relieving functional abdominal pain, juvenile diabetes mellitus and other hepatic and renal disorders of childhood.</li>
<li>Yoga seeks balance, which is lacking in most other sporting activity. A tennis player may develop the muscles of the dominant arm but the rest of the body is neglected. Through Yoga all aspects of the body are cultivated equally. Flexibility, balance, control, strength and endurance are all developed by the concept of Loma Viloma, which means to balance the opposites. For example, if we bend forward then we must bend backward also. If we perform a practice on the right side then we must balance it by performing it on the left side also. Children suffering handicaps benefit form these types of balanced practices that help them to improve and sometimes regain lost power and function of the affected body part. Polio affected limbs as well as paralyzed limbs can be benefited immensely as Yoga is able to give a sense of direction in this regard.</li>
<li>In the science of Yoga, body movement and breath must be synchronized. The body is lifted on the incoming breath and lowered on the outgoing breath. Bhastrikas or the ‘bellows breath’ activate the solar plexus, which is an energy reservoir, as well as strengthen the diaphragm thus producing strength, vitality and endurance. Pranayamas such as Mukh Bhastrika stimulate the internal cleansing of toxins. Breath is directly related to the energy levels, life span, quality of emotions, state of mind and the clarity and subtlety of thoughts. This use of breath power with the body can bring about revolutionary effects on the performance of the child and improve their state of mind, emotions and all round health. Concentration, memory and attention span are all improved thus leading to improved academic performance in slow learners.</li>
<li>Pranayama has been shown to improve lung function, heart function, cognition and helps develop an integrated personality. Pranayamas also help in improving memory and attention span as well as in reducing the stress levels.</li>
<li>Children are prone to glandular imbalance and Yoga stimulates and strengthens the endocrine system and it counteracts the body stiffness, changes in skin tone and hair, which are common problems due to glandular imbalance. Proper and proportional growth and development are helped by the Yoga practise that utilised all body parts equally. Yoga has a homeostatic influence on the psycho-neuro-immuno-endocrine system and thus both the hypo as well as the hyper functioning of the system is controlled and equilibrium is attained. This fosters positive and anabolic growth in the children so that the genetic potential can be attained in fullness of time.</li>
<li>The inculcation of Yogic values such as Yama and Niyama can go a long way in preventing numerous problems that will face the children as they mature and grow into young adults. Social life becomes much better and more pleasant when the children learn the values of Yama and Niyama. Such children will also influence their elders by stimulating them to have a second look at their decadent life styles and try to change for the better. The Yamas when practiced provide much mental solace and ethical strength to the children in the face of numerous competitions while the Niyamas produce the stoic qualities necessary for high-tension situations. Children brought up with a deep and intuitive understanding of the Yoga qualities will never become asocial or anti social beings and will have a positive self image of themselves. They will be able to relate to the society in an apt manner and foster humane attitudes. Substance abuse, juvenile delinquency and other social disorders that plague modern youth can be prevented as well as controlled through the inculcation of these values in childhood as well as in educational institutions.</li>
<li>Yogic concepts such as ‘non attachment to the fruits of one’s labour’ and ‘equal mindedness in victory and defeat’ are important attitudes in life and when children learn such values from an impressionable age they are then free from anxiety and can be confident that they have done their best at all times. Such persons have a much better chance of success than one who looks upon the competition as a life and death situation. Only a ‘quiet mind’ and ‘controlled body’ can produce real ‘skill in action’.</li>
<li>The whole philosophy of Yoga can constitute a ‘touch stone’ for children who find themselves lost when the spotlight dims or shifts its focus to another child.</li>
<li>Yoga has a lot to offer to children through the field of relaxation. In the real world, there is a lot of PUSH, PUSH and PUSH. There is very little room for</li>
